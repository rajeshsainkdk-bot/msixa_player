## 📦 Deliverables & Production APK Artifacts

Every continuous integration build generates two standalone APK packages stored directly on the machine:

```
C:\Users\rajes\Downloads\
├── Msixa-Player-APK\
│   └── msixa-player-release.apk     # Public User APK (168 MB, 17 bundled Indian tracks)
└── Msixa-Admin-APK\
    └── msixa-admin-release.apk      # Executive Admin APK (167 MB, PIN 7777 protected)
```

## 🔧 Future Development & Update Runbook

When you want to make future updates or add new features to Msixa, follow this standard procedure:

### 1. Codebase Directory
Always make edits in the root repository directory:
```
C:\Users\rajes\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\msixa_player
```

### 2. Key Files to Modify for Future Features
- **To add new songs to the bundled catalog:** Edit `lib/services/catalog_service.dart` and add corresponding audio files in `assets/audio/`.
- **To update the User UI or theme:** Edit `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` and `lib/theme/app_colors.dart`.
- **To modify Admin controls (Add / Edit / Remove):** Edit `lib/screens/admin/admin_dashboard_screen.dart` and `lib/services/cloud_backend_service.dart`.
- **To connect a real cloud backend (Cloudflare R2 / Supabase):** Replace mock network methods in `lib/services/cloud_backend_service.dart` with HTTP REST / S3 SDK calls.

### 3. Automated Push, Build & Download Pipeline
To push changes and automatically build new APKs without interruptions:
Run the automated monitoring script located at:
```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\rajes\.gemini\antigravity\brain\29cecb86-2313-4d4a-8d85-442899486999\scratch\push_and_monitor.ps1"
```
This script automatically:
1. Adds and commits all modified files to Git.
2. Pushes directly to GitHub `main` branch.
3. Hooks into GitHub Actions runner (`build_apk.yml`).
4. Compiles both release APKs.
5. Downloads and unzips both fresh APKs straight into `C:\Users\rajes\Downloads\`.
